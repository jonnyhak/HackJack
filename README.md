# HackJack

### A casino inspired app where you can bet coins in the classic game of 21!

Welcome to the HackJack Casino Gaming Room! You can sign up or log in to start. As a new user, you’ll automatically receive 20 coins in your bank to play rounds against our Dealers. Each round youcan decide how many coins to wager until you have no coins. To win a round, your cards total must get closer to 21 than the dealers without going over.

### Setup

Clone `git@github.com:jonnyhak/HackJack.git` to your local machine and run bundle install.

Then run `Rake db:migrate`

Then run `Rake db:seed`
